# How to #
## Smart-DNS-Proxy for Telerising ##

### Instructions
Use a Debian or Ubuntu box with root on a clean public CH IP and run:

    apt-get update\
	  && apt-get -y install vim dnsutils curl sudo\
	  && cd /opt\
	  && mkdir -p smart-dns-proxy\
	  && cd smart-dns-proxy\
	  && curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh || apt-get -y install docker.io\
	  && curl -fsSL https://github.com/Publish3r/smart-dns-proxy/raw/master/install.tar.gz | gunzip - | tar x --strip-components=1\
	  && ./build.sh

After successful installation, the access data for the admin panel will be displayed in the terminal.

### Authorising additional IPs or DynDNS Domains
If you want to share your system with friends and family, you can authorise their home IP address(s) using the `smart-dns-proxy` admin panel, located at `http://<ipaddr>:8080/`, where `ipaddr` is the public IP address of your VPS. Login using `admin` account with the password you recorded during the build.

### Scripted authorization of IPs
* to automatically authorise client IP using a script (where `ipaddr` is the public IP address of your VPS), substitute admin credentials and run:

```
curl -L http://<ipaddr>:8080/autoadd?username=<admin-username>&password=<admin-password>
```

* to manually authorise a specific IP, substitute admin credentials and run:

```
curl -L http://<ipaddr>:8080/autoadd?ip=<your-public-ipaddr>&username=<admin-username>&password=<admin-password>
```
